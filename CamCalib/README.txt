#Camera calibration
## OpenCV calibrateCamera
We used this method to calibrate our cameras.
Link to guide: https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d4/d94/tutorial_camera_calibration.html
We had two cameras, where one did not work as direct input for the calibration program. 
We therefore took a bunch (25) of pictures and used image list calibration mode. 
For our second camera I set Input_Delay to 5000, to have enough time to move the camera around between pictures.

camera_calibration.cpp is copied from the repository linked by the guide. 
Direct link: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.cpp

Building executable file:
g++ camera_calibration.cpp -o camera_calibration `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

Running executable file:
./camera_calibration
See comments in default.xml for explanation of different calibration settings.

Required files:
Input settings: default is default.xml
Output estimated parameters: default is out_camera_data.xml
List of pictures used for calibration: default is list_of_pictures.xml (Optional, if pictures are used for calibration)

--Camera calibration parameters--
Stored in .yaml-files. Microsoft_B means Microsoft Camera with black tape.

--Alternative method for calibrating camera--
NOTE: We did not get working results with this method. Provided as an alternative, in case the previous option does not work.
OpenCV interactive camera calibration application:
Calibrate camera with live feed from camera while moving it over a chess board.
Run this line in terminal, while in directory containing calibSettings.xml:
opencv_interactive-calibration -ci=1 -t=chessboard -sz=22 -w=9 -h=6 â€“pf=calibSettings.xml
